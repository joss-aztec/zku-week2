# MerkleTree Frontend

## Setup

This frontend assumes the MerkleTree contract has already been deployed to local node.

Run local node:

```
npx hardhat node
```

In another terminal window run the deploy:

```
npm run deploy
```

This deploy script also writes out the contract's address to `frontend/src/contracts.json`.
